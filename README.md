# BTCPrice
Java program to gather Bitcoin prices from various public sources.

Some of these prives come from various exchanges APIs, others come from scraping web pages. 

This program requires gson (tested with version ?), and Jsoup (tested with version ?).

It also needs some work.  
* the UI is not so nice. 
* we probably should find additional data and not scrape web pages.  :)
